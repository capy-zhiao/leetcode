# Greedy Algorithm

The only difficulty lies in how to derive the global optimum from local optima.
 A greedy algorithm is generally divided into the following four steps:

1. Decompose the problem into several subproblems
2. Identify an appropriate greedy strategy
3. Solve each subproblem optimally
4. Combine the local optimal solutions into a global optimal solution

## 1005[Maximize Sum Of Array After K Negations](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-sum-of-array-after-k-negations/)

For the first part, we should sort the array and flip all negative numbers to positive.

For the second part, if there are still some operations left, then:

- if `k mod 2 is 0`, flipping has no influence on the result,
- otherwise, we should sort the array again and flip the element with the smallest absolute value.
